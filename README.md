# *QALight
This story takes its beginning since 25 January thanks to the https://foundation.qalight.ua/ website.

### Prerequisites
--> I chose the Web Dev path of that program because I studied the Front-End for a year by myself.

### The Process of the selection 
1. There was a test about the Computer Literacy. <br>
2. There were webinars on 25/27 January later. <br>
3. There was a process of the selection after the previously steps. <br>

--> Gladly, I passed the test and also was chosen as the learner later.

### Why was it QALight?
--> QALight won the grant to study the vulnerable and endangered social groups of Ukrainians <br> (unemployed, IDP or those who suffering from the war).
